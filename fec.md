**Story idea**: 
### Bill Clinton's election victory was sponsored by the tobacco industry
In the 1996 US Presidential elections, the former president received more than $2 million of donations by tobacco companies. The story would look into what percentage that represents regarding other industries' donations and analyse the impact these donations had on his presidency. <br>
<br>
More information needed for this story:
* Campaign finance data from previous and subsequent elections to compare if the donations received in 1996 were larger than usual.
* List of policies adopted by Clinton's administration regarding tobacco to measure the consequences of the donations.
* Tobacco industry federal lobbying efforts from 1996 to 2000 (aproximately) to find out if there is a correlation between campaign finance and federal lobbying efforts. <br>
<br>
Potential sources: <br>

* Cristina Mora, UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies Co-Director: this institute researches campaign finance, among other topics. Its director could help analyse the impacts that tobacco industry donations may have had on Clinton's presidency
* Dick Morris, political strategist who adviced Clinton on the 1996 campaign
* Ellen Merlo, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris in 1996
